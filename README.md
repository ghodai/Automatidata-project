# Automatidata-project
The data consulting firm Automatidata has recently hired you as the newest member of their data analytics team. Their newest client, the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (New York City TLC), wants the Automatidata team to build a multiple linear regression model to predict taxi fares using existing data that was collected over a year. The team is getting closer to completing the project, having completed an initial plan of action, initial Python coding work, EDA, and A/B testing.
